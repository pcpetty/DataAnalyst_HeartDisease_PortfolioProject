# FoodWheel-Analysis

This repository contains a detailed analysis of FoodWheel's delivery data to understand customer behavior, delivery patterns, and operational efficiency. The project leverages data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning techniques to derive actionable insights for optimizing delivery operations.

## Project Overview

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze delivery patterns and customer behavior to identify areas for operational improvement and enhance customer satisfaction.

### Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformation.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and patterns in customer orders and delivery data.
- **Statistical Analysis and Modeling**: Applying statistical tests and predictive modeling to uncover insights.
- **Machine Learning**: Using clustering and regression techniques to predict delivery times and segment customers.

## Data

The dataset used in this project includes customer orders, delivery times, and operational metrics. Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering are performed before the analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Visualizing customer order trends, delivery times, and operational metrics to identify patterns and outliers.

2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Analyzing delivery times and identifying factors that influence delivery efficiency.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Using machine learning models to predict delivery times based on customer location, order details, and operational factors.

4. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Applying clustering techniques to segment customers based on ordering behavior and preferences.

## Results

The analysis of FoodWheel’s delivery data has revealed several critical insights into customer behavior and operational efficiency. Key findings indicate that delivery times and customer satisfaction are influenced by factors such as distance to delivery locations, peak order times, and delivery zone efficiency. Additionally, customer segmentation has shown distinct patterns in ordering behavior, which can be leveraged to tailor marketing strategies and optimize delivery routes.
